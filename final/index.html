                <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. With SQL, you can perform various operations on databases, such as creating and modifying database schemas, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and retrieving data based on specific criteria.</p><br>
                <p>It's commonly used in web development, data analysis, and many other fields where structured data management is crucial. SQL allows users to interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.</p><br>

            <h2>What does SQL look like?</h2><br>
            <p>SQL code consists of statements that are used to perform various operations on a database. Here are some basic SQL statements and what they typically look like:</p><br>
            <h3>Creating a Table:</h3>
                <code>
                    CREATE TABLE Employees (
                    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
                    LastName VARCHAR(50),
                    Department VARCHAR(50),
                    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
                    );
                </code>
            <p>This statement creates a table named "Employees" with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, and Salary.</p><br>
            <h3>Inserting Data:</h3>
                <code>
                    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
                    VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'Sales', 50000.00),
                        (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'Marketing', 60000.00);
                </code>
            <p>This inserts records into the "Employees" table with specified values for each column.</p><br>
            <h3>Querying Data:</h3>
                <code>
                    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
                    FROM Employees
                    WHERE Department = 'Sales';
                </code>
            <p>This retrieves the FirstName, LastName, and Department columns from the "Employees" table where the Department is 'Sales'.</p><br>
            <h3>Updating Data:</h3>
                <code>
                    UPDATE Employees
                    SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
                    WHERE Department = 'Sales';
                </code>
            <p>This increases the Salary of employees in the 'Sales' department by 10%.</p><br>
            <h3>Deleting Data:</h3>
                <code>
                    DELETE FROM Employees
                    WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
                </code>
            <p>This deletes a specific record from the "Employees" table based on the EmployeeID.</p><br>
            <p>SQL syntax can vary slightly depending on the specific database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.) and may include additional functionalities or specific features unique to that system. However, the core structure and functionality of SQL statements remain relatively consistent across different databases.</p>

            <h2>Are there different types of SQL?</h2><br>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. However, there are different implementations and dialects of SQL that might have variations in syntax, features, and functionalities.</p><br>
            <h3>Some SQL Variations Include:</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standard SQL (ANSI SQL):</strong> This is the standardized version of SQL defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It sets the standard for the core syntax and functionalities that all SQL databases should follow. Most databases strive to adhere to ANSI SQL standards, but they often include their extensions and specific features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Database-Specific SQL Dialects:</strong> Each database system may have its own dialect of SQL. For instance:                
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="indent"><strong>MySQL SQL:</strong> MySQL has its own specific features and variations in syntax, especially with respect to data types and certain functions.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="indent"><strong>Transact-SQL (T-SQL):</strong> This is the SQL dialect used in Microsoft SQL Server. It includes additional features such as stored procedures, triggers, and functions specific to SQL Server.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="indent"><strong>PL/SQL:</strong> This is the procedural language extension for Oracle databases, allowing users to write procedural logic like loops and conditions within SQL statements.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="indent"><strong>PostgreSQL SQL:</strong> PostgreSQL might have certain advanced features or syntax variations that are specific to its implementation.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>    
                <li>
                    <strong>SQL Extensions:</strong> Some databases introduce extensions to standard SQL to provide additional functionalities. These could include vendor-specific functions, optimizations, or features that are not part of the standard SQL.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NoSQL Query Languages:</strong> While SQL is primarily used for relational databases, there are NoSQL databases that use query languages tailored to their data models. These languages, such as MongoDB's query language (not SQL-based), are specific to non-relational databases.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>While the core principles of SQL remain consistent across databases, the specific syntax, supported functions, and additional features can vary. It's important to be aware of these differences when working with different database systems. Learning the fundamentals of SQL allows for easier adaptation to various SQL dialects and implementations.</p>

            <p class="quote">"ChatGPT 3.5 is an AI language model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It's part of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series developed by OpenAI. This version, an iteration before my own, was adept at various language tasks, including answering questions, generating text, aiding in content creation, providing information, and holding conversations on a wide range of topics. It was trained on an extensive dataset, allowing it to offer contextually relevant and coherent responses to diverse prompts." -ChatGPT 3.5</p>

            <p class="quote">"As of my last update in January 2022, Microsoft Bing Image Creator was a tool integrated into the Bing search engine that allowed users to create custom images using various templates, backgrounds, text, and shapes. It offered a user-friendly interface for designing visuals for presentations, social media, blog posts, and other content. The tool provided options for customization, including different fonts, colors, and elements to create personalized images for different purposes. Users could access this feature directly within Bing's image search, enabling them to craft visuals without the need for separate graphic design software." -ChatGPT 3.5</p>
