### What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables made up of rows and columns, with each row representing a record and each column representing an attribute or field of that record. These databases follow the principles of the relational model, proposed by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s.

Key characteristics of relational databases include:

1. Tables: Data is stored in tables, where each table has a unique name and consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes or fields). Tables are related to each other based on common fields.

2. Relationships: Relationships are established between tables using keys (primary keys and foreign keys). A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key links a record in one table to a record in another table.

3. Structured Query Language (SQL): Relational databases use SQL for querying and manipulating data. SQL allows users to perform operations like retrieving, updating, deleting, and inserting data into tables.

4. Data Integrity: Relational databases enforce data integrity by defining constraints such as primary key constraints, unique constraints, and foreign key constraints. These constraints ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data.

5. Normalization: Normalization is a process used to organize data to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down tables into smaller, more manageable parts to reduce data duplication and improve efficiency.

Popular examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite. Relational databases are widely used in various industries and applications due to their structured format, ability to handle complex queries, and strong support for data integrity.

   - Storage Engine: MySQL supports multiple storage engines, each optimized for specific use cases, providing different functionalities and performance characteristics.
   - Data Handling: MySQL manages data in tables, following the relational model, organizing data into rows and columns.
   - Indexing: MySQL uses indexes to optimize data retrieval, supporting different index types (e.g., B-tree, hash) to enhance query performance.
4. Database Objects and Operations:
   - Tables: Data is stored in tables that define the structure and schema of the stored data.
   - Indexes: Indexes are used to facilitate quicker data retrieval based on specific columns.
   - Stored Procedures and Functions: MySQL supports stored procedures and user-defined functions written in SQL or other languages.
   - Views: Virtual tables generated from queries, presenting a specific subset or transformation of data.
   - Triggers: Database actions (like insert, update, delete) that are automatically executed based on specified conditions.
5. Administration and Management:
   - Configuration and Security: MySQL allows configuration of various parameters and settings for performance optimization, security measures, and resource management.
   - Backup and Recovery: MySQL provides mechanisms for creating backups and restoring data in case of failures or data loss.
   - Monitoring and Optimization: Tools and commands are available for monitoring server performance, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing query execution.

MySQL's architecture, functionality, and performance make it a popular choice for web applications, small to mid-sized systems, and environments where an open-source RDBMS is preferred. Its versatility, scalability, and widespread community support contribute to its popularity among developers and organizations.

## What does the MySQL database look like?

In MySQL, the database is structured hierarchically and contains various components that organize and manage data. Here's an overview of what a MySQL database looks like:

- Databases:
  - MySQL operates within a server environment and can host multiple databases.
  - Each database is a separate logical entity containing its own set of tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, and other objects.
  - Databases provide logical separation and security boundaries for data.
- Tables and Data:
  - Tables are the fundamental structure for storing data in MySQL.
  - Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields) defining the data's structure and types.
  - Tables hold the actual data, and data in one table can be related to data in other tables through keys (primary keys, foreign keys).
- Schemas:
  - MySQL uses schemas as containers to organize database objects like tables, views, functions, and procedures.
  - By default, MySQL places tables within a schema named `public`, but users can create additional schemas for better organization and management.
- Indexes:
  - Indexes in MySQL help optimize data retrieval by providing quick access paths to specific data within tables.
  - Different types of indexes (B-tree, hash, etc.) can be created based on the requirements to improve query performance.
- Views and Stored Procedures:
  - Views are virtual tables generated by queries, presenting data in a predefined format. They help simplify complex queries or restrict data access.
  - Stored procedures are sets of SQL statements stored in the database and executed as a unit. They offer reusable code and help perform complex operations.
- Triggers and Events:
  - Triggers in MySQL are actions that automatically execute in response to certain database events (like insert, update, delete) based on specified conditions.
  - Events are scheduled tasks that execute automatically at predefined times or intervals.
- Administration and Management:
  - MySQL provides command-line tools (like `mysql`) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or Navicat for database management, querying, and administration.
  - Configuration parameters allow users to manage server settings, security measures, and performance tuning.

This structured approach of databases, tables, schemas, and other database objects in MySQL provides a framework for organizing and managing data effectively, allowing for scalability, security, and efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

# Flexbox

I used flexbox in my menu "bars" located in the header section and the aside sidebar, and I used it in the color palette section of the sitemap page. 

In the menu navigation bar on the top of the page, I styled it as a centered row for the main site links (each one having its own div tag). They also change color when the links are visited or hovered over 

section.menu {
    height: auto;
    width: 100%;
    margin-inline: auto;
    border: solid #FF934F;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #FF934F;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: space-evenly;
    gap: 3rem;
}

In the sidebar menu in the right section of the page, it inherited some of the styles from the other menu flowbox. But it is centered column rather than row. There was content and pictures included in the sidebar to fill it out to limit empty space. Changed the background color to make it different looking from the other menu.

aside.menu2 {
    height: 100%;
    width: 600px;
    right: 0;
    margin-inline: auto;
    border: solid #FF934F;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #2B3A67;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    align-content: space-evenly;
    gap: 3rem;
}

# Grid

I used grid to section the body of the webpage between the header, footer, main, and sidebar into their own defined areas of the page. I keep the grid style simple to make it the clean and organized.

body {
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    background-color: #191923;
    color: #DAF5FF;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: 50px auto 50px;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd" 
        "hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd hd" 
        "mn mn mn mn mn mn mn sb sb"
        "mn mn mn mn mn mn mn sb sb"
        "mn mn mn mn mn mn mn sb sb"
        "ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft";
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
