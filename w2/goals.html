            <dt>My Academic Goals:</dt>

            <dd>I made the decision to go back to school to earn a certificate in Web Development. I wish to learn something different in IT and use the information learned from classes under the Web Development certificate to start maintaining websites and databases for my employer. I am aiming to complete this certificate by Spring 2024 to Fall 2024.</dd>

            <dt>My Personal Goals:</dt>

            <dd>I currently work in the field of IT for the State of California in IT Asset Management and IT Procurement. I want to do something different and more fulfilling than what I do now. I am hoping I can move into a Database Administrator role and a Web Developer role. What I learn from SQL class and from this class and the future JavaScript class will help with my goal. I am also hoping that the skills from these classes will help earn a promotion to a Tech Lead position.</dd>
